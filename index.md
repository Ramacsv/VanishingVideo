_Srinivasa said "YUBA"   Aha. Let’s all see if the flower is causing the problem._

_They ran up to upstairs room,  found the flower and moved it out side the house._

_Now they tried watching video and it worked great._

_The interesting thing is that the video has Srinivasa mammoth and Kamala fox ancestors._
